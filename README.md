# 👋 Hey, I'm Sandi

**Cloud & DevOps Enthusiast**  
*AWS Certified (SAA-C03, Cloud Practitioner)*

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m passionate about designing and building hands-on labs using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Terraform**, with a strong focus on real-world cloud infrastructure scenarios.  
I actively explore and implement **DevOps practices**, from **CI/CD pipelines** to **infrastructure automation**, using tools like **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, and **GitLab CI**.  
I’m also expanding my cloud expertise by working with both core and DevOps-related services across **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** — including compute, networking, storage, identity, monitoring, and IaC tools.

📍 **Currently based in Bangkok**, I'm open to new opportunities where I can apply my skills, support a collaborative team, and grow in a field I'm deeply passionate about.  
I'm committed to continuous learning, delivering value, and always striving to do my best in every project I take on.
