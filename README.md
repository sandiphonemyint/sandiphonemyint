## 🧑‍💻 About Me

🌐 With 3 years of hands-on IT experience, I specialize in IT support, system administration, and infrastructure operations across both on-premise and cloud environments.

I'm passionate about cloud technologies and building hands-on labs with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Terraform**. I actively learn and implement **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **CI/CD pipelines**. My cloud experience spans **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**, focusing on compute, networking, storage, identity, monitoring, and automation.

📍 **Based in Bangkok**, I'm open to new opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and support a collaborative team. I'm committed to continuous learning and always strive to deliver value through my work.
